phpPgAdmin Installation Guide
-----------------------------

1. Unpack your download

   If you've downloaded a tar.gz package, execute from a terminal:

   gunzip phpPgAdmin-*.tar.gz
   tar -xvf phpPgAdmin-*.tar

   Else, if you've downloaded a tar.bz2 package, execute from a terminal: 

   bunzip2 phpPgAdmin-*.tar.bz2
   tar -xvf phpPgAdmin-*.tar

   Else, if you've downloaded a zip package, execute from a terminal:

   unzip phpPgAdmin-*.zip

2. Configure phpPgAdmin

   edit phpPgAdmin/conf/config.inc.php

   If you mess up the configuration file, you can recover it from the
   config.inc.php-dist file.

3. Set up the reports database.

   If you want to enable reports (which are a useful feature) then go to
   the 'sql' subdirectory and view the SQL script for your database.  It
   will contain instructions on how to set up the reports database.

4. If you run your PHP installation in safe mode, in order that the database
   dump feature can work correctly, you need to set the 'safe_mode_allowed_env_vars'
   php.ini variable to include the PGPASSWORD and PGUSER environmental variables
   and the safe_mode_exec_dir to include /usr/bin (or wherever the pg_dump
   binaries are found).
   
   	eg. safe_mode_allowed_env_vars = PHP_,PG
   	    safe_mode_exec_dir = /usr/bin
   
   Given that you usually don't want to allow everything in /usr/bin to
   be executed, you might want to copy the pg_dump and pg_dumpall utilities
   to a directory by themselves.
   
   Also, you will need to ensure that your 'pg_dump' and 'pg_dumpall' utilities
   are executable by the PHP process, if you want dump support in phpPgAdmin.

   Lastly, if you run phpPgAdmin in safe mode, very long running imports,
   exports and transactions may time out and be aborted.

5. Enable the statistics collector in PostgreSQL.  phpPgAdmin will display
   table and index performance and usage statistics if you have enabled the
   PostgreSQL statistics collector.  To enable the collector, uncomment the
   following lines in your postgresql.conf and enable them:

   	stats_start_collector = true
	stats_command_string = true
	stats_block_level = true
	stats_row_level = true

6. Browse to the phpPgAdmin installation using a web browser.  You might
   need cookies enabled for phpPgAdmin to work.

7. IMPORTANT - SECURITY

   PostgreSQL by default does not require you to use a password to log in.
   We STRONGLY recomment that you enable md5 passwords for local connections
   in your pg_hba.conf, and set a password for the default superuser account.

   Due to the large number of phpPgAdmin installations that have not set
   passwords on local connections, there is now a configuration file
   option called 'extra_login_security', which is TRUE by default.  While
   this option is enabled, you will be unable to log in to phpPgAdmin as
   the 'root', 'administrator', 'pgsql' or 'postgres' users and empty passwords
   will not work.
   
   Once you are certain you have properly secured your database server, you
   can then disable 'extra_login_security' so that you can log in as your
   database administrator using the administrator password.
