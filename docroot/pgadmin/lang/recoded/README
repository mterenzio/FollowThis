Translators
-----------

Please read the TRANSLATORS file in the top directory.

This directory contains the HTML Unicode recodings of the source
language files.  These are the actual files used by phpPgAdmin
when displaying strings.

Instructions on recoding:

cd lang
make <language>  (eg. 'french')

Running make with no arguments will recode all language files:

cd lang
make

To check your translation:

cd lang
php langcheck <language> (eg. 'french');

To synchronize your translation with english.php:

cd lang
./synch <language> (eg. 'polish');
